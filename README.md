## Team Contributions
Omar Ahmadyar
- Causal consistency implementation
   - Vector clock implementation (vc.py)
   - Causal history checks (ie vector clock checks and handling in int_put_key, int_del_key and read_key)
   - Vector clock/causal metadata updates (maintaining accurate vector clocks)
- Sharding implementation
   - Asyncronous communication between shards in shard.py
   - Hashing of keys to their respective shard, keeping track of shard ids
   - Resharding implementation
   - Maintence of the view
- Testing/debugging of python implementation
   - Running and testing python nodes directly

Ryan Steinwert
- Routing of requests in route*.py
   - Handling client requests using Flask routing
   - Responding to requests with proper json formatting
- Docker file
- Documentation (readme and in-code)
- Testing/debugging of concurrent nodes and docker implementation
   - Running docker containers on subnet with manual testing
   - Using provided test suite

Pair programming was used for a significant percentage of code
